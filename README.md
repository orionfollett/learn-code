# Introduction

## Python
Your first programming language will be Python. It is a really powerful language that has been used to develop lots of computer programs like:
- Youtube
- Google
- Reddit
- Spotify
- Instagram
- ChatGPT
- Parts of Battlefield 2
- Sim 4
- etc

Python is very similar to many other programming languages, so once you have mastered Python, it won't be too hard to switch to most other languages.

> **_IMPORTANT_** When you're learning Python, do not copy and paste code, even if it seems repetitive, it is good muscle memory to type everything out when you are learning.

## Terminal
The terminal, command line, or powershell, are all essentially the same thing.

On Windows, type "cmd" into your windows search bar, this will pull up the windows command line.

The terminal lets you interact directly with your operating system by typing commands, instead of clicking a GUI (graphical user interface) on your screen.

## Git
To share lessons with you, we will use a tool called "git".
Git has many functions but one of them is that it makes it easy to share code over the internet. It's like a more powerful but more complicated Google Drive.

Git needs to be installed on most machines, here is a link: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Git uses the terminal. 

Create a folder where you want to save your work.

Inside the folder, right click and select "Terminal"

To first get the repo paste this command into your terminal:

```console
git clone https://github.com/orionfollett/learn-code.git
```

To get updates to the repo enter these commands one after another in the folder where you cloned this project:

```console
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
```

The first command saves your work and hides it
The second command pulls new changes
The third command brings your work back on top of the new changes

## VSCode

VSCode is a lightweight but powerful code editor.

Download VSCode here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

You can open any folder on your computer by going to that folder, right clicking, selecting "Terminal" and typing

```console
code .
```

Once you are in VSCode:
- click the stacked boxes icon in the left toolbar, or use the keyboard short cut: Ctrl+Shift+X
- Search for Python, and install the first package, authored by Microsoft



##Final Thoughts

Learning to code is like learning a new language. Be patient with yourself and learn the basics well
and before you know it you will be creating really cool things!
