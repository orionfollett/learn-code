# Introduction

## Python
Your first programming language will be Python. It is a really powerful language that has been used to develop lots of computer programs like:
- Youtube
- Google
- Reddit
- Spotify
- Instagram
- ChatGPT
- Parts of Battlefield 2
- Sim 4
- etc

Python is very similar to many other programming languages, so once you have mastered Python, it won't be too hard to switch to most other languages.


## Git
To share lessons with you, we will use a tool called "git".
Git has many functions but one of them is that it makes it easy to share code over the internet. It's like a more powerful but more complicated Google Drive.


Git uses the terminal. 


To first get the repo:
git clone {repo url}


To get updates to the repo enter these commands one after another in the folder where you cloned this project:

git stash
git pull
git stash pop


The first command saves your work and hides it
The second command pulls new changes
The third command brings your work back on top of the new changes
