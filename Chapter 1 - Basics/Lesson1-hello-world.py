#LESSON 1 - Hello World


#This is a comment, it is a comment because of the '#' symbol, the computer ignores anything after the '#' symbol, but only on the line with that symbol


#Setup for this lesson:
# - Create the universe and all of evolution
# - Have a computer
# - Install Git
# - Clone this repo
# - Install Python
# - Download VSCode
# - Install VSCode Python Extension








#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#Lesson 1.1 - Hello World

#The first program everyone learns is called "Hello World".
#This is where you learn how to make your computer say hello to the world.

#In python, you can use the function: print
print("Hello World")

#To run this code: Hit 'F5' on your keyboard, and then if VSCode asks you for a 'debug configuration' just click "Python File, Debug the currently active Python file"
#If you have questions about this step let me know.

#You should see a terminal pop up in your VSCode, where some commands will run this computer program, and print the output of the program, in this case: "Hello World"


#TASKS for Lesson 1.1:
#1. Write some code to say the word hello, and then your name.


#2. Write some code to say hello world 3 times. Now make it write your name 10 times.









#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Lesson 1.2 - Functions

#Let's break down how that first command works:

#the 'print' statement is called a function, and is a built in feature that Python provides to print things to your terminal

#ALL functions follow the same basic format:
#1. They have a name, in this case 'print'
#2. They have parenthesis that come after the name
#3. Inside the parenthesis, they have zero, one, or more 'input parameters' also called 'arguments' that are separated by commas (in this case there is only one argument).
#   These are inputs that the function takes, and does things with them. Common jargon is to say we "pass" arguments to a function.
#   In this case, 'print' takes only one argument, ' "Hello World" '. 
#   In other words, We "pass" the string "hello world" to the function "print". 

#print takes one argument, a string (more on that later), and prints it to your terminal.


#TASKS for Lesson 1.2
#1. What happens if you don't pass in any arguments to the 'print' function? 

#2. What happens if you try to pass in two strings to the print function? What error do you get?

#Lesson 1.3 - Some quirks of Python:

#You may have already noticed a few quirks about this particular programming language, Python
#The first thing to be aware of in Python, is that indentation matters. If you try to write code
#at different indentations that Python is not expecting, it will throw errors at you and not run. Indents are 
#tabs or spaces at the beginning of a new line

#Python also has a lot less syntax than other programming languages. 
#Syntax is like grammar in human languages, they are the rules of how languages are written down.

#for example the idea that functions have a name with no spaces in them, followed by parenthesis containing arguments separated by commans
#is part of the syntax of Python.

#Many languages have a lot of syntax overhead that makes them harder to get started learning how to program.


#TASKS for Lesson 1.3:

#1. What happens if you type the print command but you put a space before the print statement? What happens if you put a 'tab' before the print statement

#2. What happens if you put a period at the end of the line (like most English sentences)? Or if you put a semicolon at the end of the line (like most other programming languages)?




#Learning programming is like learning another language, so it's good to keep track of words that may be new to you:

#Define these things in your own words or using mine:

#Vocabulary:
#function - 
#syntax - 
#arguments - 
#indent - 
#pass, as in passing an argument to a function -
